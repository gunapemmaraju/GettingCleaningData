### Project Introduction 
This Project works on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"<br>
Source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The goal of the project is to create a script named, run_analysis.R, which does the below steps.

1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This list of steps and, more details about the project can be found at : https://class.coursera.org/getdata-006 under the Project section.

### Pre-requisites
a) The script, run_analysis.R, and the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory should be in the same parent directory (say DIR)

b) The parent directory (DIR) should be set as the working director. 
If any of these assumptions are invalid. The code can easily be modified to accomodate the same. 

###Outputs
1. The tidy dataset would be created in a file named tidy.txt
2. Certain assumptions have been made about the requirements, but none of them are too rigid. And code can easily be changed to accomodate
and differences
3. The codebook is in a file named, codebook.md. And this can be used to quickly understand details about the data, the steps followed and what the variables are about.
